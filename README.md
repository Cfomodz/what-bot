A helpful robot with access to tools like PCGS' API, eBay's API, and direct integration to several seller tools I have released. Intended to help automate the coin and currency seller workflow, from acquiring inventory and tracking packages to creating (and now posting!) item listings for you to multiple marketplaces and removing them when it sells.
